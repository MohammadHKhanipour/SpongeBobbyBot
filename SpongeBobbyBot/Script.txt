French Narrator: Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life. [shows from left to right Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses. Zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly. [Scene cuts to the house's bedroom. A sea snail is seen sleeping near a pile of newspapers on the floor, a scallop is seen in a birdcage, and a young, optimistic sea sponge is seen sleeping in his bed, snoring as his foghorn alarm clock ticks. SpongeBob's alarm then sounds. He wakes, but is unaffected by the annoying sound, and with a smile on his face, turns it off. He climbs from his bed to a ladder, leading to his diving board.]
SpongeBob SquarePants: Today's the big day, Gary!
Garold "Gary" Wilson Jr. The Snail: Meow.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the diving board] Look at me, I'm... [jumps up, and leaves his underwear behind] ...naked! [lands inside his pants, then walks over to the exercise room. His head pops out of the top of his pants.] Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [taking deep breaths, he prepares to lift a barbell that is balanced by two lightweight stuffed animals. He sticks out his chest, but almost passes out because he can barely lift it. He drops it, and it makes a "squeak" noise] I'm ready!!! [runs outside] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! [a dimwitted sea star's rock tilts upwards with him stuck to its underside.]
Patrick Star: Go, SpongeBob! [falls] Whoa! [crash sound effect]
SpongeBob (1997 Version): I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [jumps in the air as the scene freezes and a title reads SpongeBob SquarePants]
Narrator (1997 Version) : SpongeBob SquarePants! [It shows SpongeBob running through various landscapes, as it shows a frozen scene of SpongeBob standing in front of the Krusty Krab the scene unfreezes and then the episode continues as normal]
SpongeBob: [runs down the street to the Krusty Krab] There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty... with a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye [breaks the fourth wall and looks the audience in the eye], lay it on the line and... I can't do this! [starts to run home, but Patrick stops him.] Hey, Patrick-
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just...
Patrick: No, you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get! That! Job!
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Whose first words were "May I take your order?"?
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.
Patrick: [grimaces and contorts twice while trying to come up with a good third line] Who's a, uh, who's uhh, oh! And who's a big yellow cube with holes?
SpongeBob: I am!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?!
SpongeBob: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. An octopus is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows.]
Squidward J. Q. Tentacles: [cleaning graffiti of himself with the word "loser," sees SpongeBob, and sighs] Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: [in background, at first while Squidward was talking] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self! [Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside.]
Squidward: [While SpongeBob says, "I'm ready," one more time in the background] Mr. Krabs! [cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.] Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- [interrupted by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard, captain! [deep voice] I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew [normal voice] and now I'm ready! [SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. Mr. Krabs and Squidward look at each other. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.] So, uh, when do I start?
Eugene Harold Krabs: Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please! I'll prove I'm fry cook material! Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob]
Squidward: [deep breath] No. [Mr. Krabs winks. They head back to SpongeBob, who looks completely puzzled at what he's hearing]
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... [SpongeBob takes out a notepad] a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula... [SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says] with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, [more scribbling] and, uh... turbo drive. [more scribbling] And don't come back ‘til you get one. [puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile]
SpongeBob: [saluting Krabs] Aye aye, captain! [reading] One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Carry on! [SpongeBob leaves] We'll never see that lubber again.
Squidward: You're terrible. A hydro-what? [he and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Mr. Krabs laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.]
Bus driver: Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their fins out the window! [the buses surround the Krusty Krab and the doors open and Mr. Krabs stops laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] That sounded like hatch doors! [sniffs repeatedly] Do you smell it? That smell... A kind of smelly smell... A smelly smell that smells... smelly... [his eyes widen] Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: Anchovies!! [the anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word "meep" over and over again]
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! [the anchovies stop talking] Is this any way to behave, hmm?
Anchovy: Meep.
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? [The anchovies stare for a moment, then pick up the boat, as their cries of "meep!" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: [singing to himself] ♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪ [cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.]
Mr. Krabs: All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Squidward: One single file line was all I asked!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [he and Squidward are thrown up in the air] Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters] We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward] I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! [cuts to Barg'N-Mart]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪ [cuts back to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Help!
Mr. Krabs: Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! [They climb the mast, while the anchovies try to get them down. The anchovies then form a big wave.]
Anchovies: Meep! Meep!
Mr. Krabs: This is the end! Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [They cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stuttering in shock at SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula]
SpongeBob: That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with [two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one] port-and-starboard attachments! And let's not forget the turbo drive! [the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face] Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! [to the anchovies] Who's hungry?! [Tiny Tim's "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" plays while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the order window to the hungry anchovies. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses. SpongeBob blows the spatula. Cuts to later.]
Mr. Krabs: That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. [gives SpongeBob a name tag]
Squidward: B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray, Mr.—
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. Mr. Krabs—
Mr. Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. [wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. Patrick enters]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty, please. [The instrumental to "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula, and a score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which collide with Patrick and send him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.]
Patrick: [screams]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee! "[The End]"
[Squidward opens his door, sees that a flower does not stand up straight and then fixes it.]
[The scene pans to show that everything on his lawn is clean, except for a seashell on the left side of it.]
[The camera shows Squidward angry. He walks over to the seashell, looks around and kicks it onto SpongeBob's lawn while whistling casually.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house. The window opens, and SpongeBob's face is shown. He exits through his window and sits on its rim. He notices the seashell on his lawn, he gets an idea and starts sliding to the back of his house to his garage to get a reef blower. The giant backpack-like container, with a blower hose, which looks like a jet engine, a power switch, and a pull starter.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward resting on his hammock.]
[Squidward hears the reef blower's motor throbbing. He sees SpongeBob exiting out of his garage with the reef blower. Squidward grumbles and puts in his ear plugs so that he can continue to rest.]
[SpongeBob gets to the seashell and tries to blow it away from his lawn by using the reef blower. He does this twice. He then blows extra hard, and a huge amount of sand is thrown in the air.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward eating some vegetables when the huge amount of sand falls from the sky and buries him. SpongeBob runs towards Squidward and blows the sand away.]
[Squidward looks at a leaf on his plate with grains of sand on it.]
[SpongeBob cleans the leaf in front of Squidward's head, tearing apart half of the leaf and causing grains of sand to get into Squidward's eyes. SpongeBob cleans Squidward's eyes with another blow.]
[The scene changes to show a large pile of sand on SpongeBob's lawn.]
[SpongeBob points his finger to it and mouths a word and the caption says "You!". He walks to the pile of sand, sets the reef blower to reverse and uses it suck up the sand from his lawn.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's lawn clean, but then reef blower starts breaking apart, throwing out sand and parts of the machinery.]
[SpongeBob takes off the reef blower. He unzips the pack. He goes over to pick up the thrown out contents. The reef blower coughs while he is absent. He returns with large hands carrying the thrown out contents. He zips it back up and pulls the pull starter in an attempt to try to start it. The motor starts and then dies.]
[The camera shows him becoming angry or just determined. The scene changes and he pulls the handle very far.]
[SpongeBob lets go of the handle, which stays still. SpongeBob wipes his hands together. He grabs the handle again. The handle pulls him away, leaving a bubble silhouette of SpongeBob that quickly dissolves. SpongeBob passes an intersection where two fish in two different cars going opposite directions stop. He passes some houses and finally returns to the reef blower, where he gets strapped in.]
[The reef blower starts, sucking up all the water in the sea, causing Squidward, who is sitting on his front doorstep, to gasp due to the inability to breathe air. His eyes also change into X's.]
[The scene changes to show the reef blower massive, and then it explodes, causing water to cover the screen. When the water stops, the screen shows big piles of sand everywhere, but SpongeBob's lawn is relatively clean.]
[SpongeBob exits one of the piles, wipes his hands together, and happily enters his house.]
[Episode ends with Squidward at his doorstep, with a pile of sand covering him except for his head. The seashell falls on Squidward's nose. Squidward narrows his eyelids.]
SpongeBob: [stands in Jellyfish Fields. A blue jellyfish floats by SpongeBob. SpongeBob creeps from behind a bush and stares at the jellyfish through a telescope. Cuts to his view with the telescope] Wow, four stingers. [puts away the telescope and puts on his glasses. Cuts to the jellyfish, where SpongeBob floats over it with his net. Cuts to the jellyfish alone, where SpongeBob's foot stretches out from off-screen and then the rest of his body appears. He attempts to grab the jellyfish in his net, but he catches himself in the net, then the jellyfish flies away. In the background, a young girl's voice is heard struggling. SpongeBob looks down a cliff and sees a land creature trying to fight a giant clam that's attempting to eat her. SpongeBob gasps.] Where have I seen this before? [takes out his Field Guide book and skims through the pages] Here it is. [cut to picture of a squirrel] Land squirrel. [closes the book] That little squirrel is in trouble. [cuts to the squirrel, who is pushing the clam into the ground]
Sandra "Sandy" Jennifer Cheeks: Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners! [walks away] You're about as ugly as homemade soup.
SpongeBob: Hooray, land squirrel! [cuts back to the land squirrel, who is oblivious to the clam resurfacing and jumping right at her. Cuts to SpongeBob, who is shocked, his glasses shoot up] Look out! [scene cuts to the clam with Sandy trying to escape the clam] Hold on, little squirrel! [does a karate yell in front of the clam, then does the same while bouncing to different sides. He jumps high in the air, and lands on top of the clam; he poses on top of the giant clam.] You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai! [tries to pry open the clam; he stops] Hey, I'm actually doing it. [SpongeBob continues, Sandy finishes prying the clam open from inside it and SpongeBob goes flying into a sea plant.] Your shell is mine!
[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and starts to charge at the clam. He jumps into the clam's mouth and starts to strangle its tongue. SpongeBob sees that Sandy has already escaped and the clam swallows him now.]
Sandy: Hold on there, little square dude! [gets SpongeBob out and kicks the clam around some more and finally kicks it across the sea. The clam whimpers. Sandy leans down to see if SpongeBob is okay.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you like karate too. [does some karate poses, then he stops and falls flat on his head] So, what's your name?
Sandy: Sandy. [makes athletic moves] So what do y'all call yourself?
SpongeBob: [runs up a big rock] I'm SpongeBob! [jumps down, SpongeBob soon lands on one of his corners]
Sandy: Well, SpongeBob, take a gander at this. [walks next to a huge rock and slaps it with her hand, making a gong sound effect which precedes the rock breaking into pieces]
SpongeBob: Oh. [Sandy grins and blinks] Oh yeah? Watch this [prepares to do a karate move, but all he does is make an armpit fart noise. Sandy walks on-screen giggling]
Sandy: I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah! [karate chops SpongeBob’s head.]
SpongeBob: Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! [karate chops her helmet, but realizes it hurts.] Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?
Sandy: Why, that's my air helmet.
SpongeBob: May I try it on?
Sandy: Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air.
SpongeBob: Me too. I love air. Air is good.
Sandy: No kidding?
SpongeBob: Why, "air" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air.
Sandy: Shee-oot. How about comin' over tomorrow for tea and cookies then? [shows a map leading to Sandy's house] Don't be late.
SpongeBob: Okay, see you tomorrow. [runs to Patrick's house. Patrick is sun tanning on his rock] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air.
Patrick: Do you mean she puts on "airs"?
SpongeBob: I guess so.
Patrick: That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are.
SpongeBob: [holds his pinky up] How's that?
Patrick: Higher.
SpongeBob: Like that?
Patrick: Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants. [cuts to Sandy's treedome] Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching. [opens the door as SpongeBob walks in with his pinky raised high and flowers in his right hand.]
SpongeBob: Thanks, pal. [rings the doorbell with a bouquet in his hand]
Sandy: Hello?
SpongeBob: Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hold on a sec, I'll let you in.
SpongeBob: [whistles then all the water goes down the drain, then bangs on the door] Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob jiggles on the ground] Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in... [looks around] ...here.
Sandy: ‘Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air.
SpongeBob: [waves his hand around and smells the air] No water?
Sandy: That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Problem? [laughing] Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! [takes a deep breath as Sandy walks off. As soon as she leaves, he lets it all out, and gets black circles around his eyes] With no water.
Sandy: [cartwheeling] Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah! [SpongeBob is walking an inch forward and it makes weak squeaking sounds with every step] That's not in. In. [SpongeBob walks another inch and there is more squeaking. Sandy runs, gets SpongeBob, takes his hand, and runs off] You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour. [fades to the blazing sun and pan down where Sandy and SpongeBob are standing] So this is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest... [SpongeBob gasps] ...purest... [SpongeBob gasps again] ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath. [Cuts to the birdbath, where a red robin is splashing and chirping] And that's my oak tree. [SpongeBob seems enticed by the water in the birdbath. He tries to sneak away, but stays until Sandy lets her guard down] It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bee's knees? [SpongeBob nods] Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I... [SpongeBob finally escapes and wallows in the birdbath, absorbing all the water. He then jumps back to his original spot, and the bird is quite angry. SpongeBob gets back before Sandy notices] ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let’s have that tea now. [does in-air karate moves and moves off-screen. SpongeBob gasps. He hears some knocking from outside. It's Patrick, pointing at his pinky]
Patrick: Pinky. Pinky.
SpongeBob: [blinks, weakly holds up his pinky, and gasps again. Fade to him sitting at a picnic bench. He now has little wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth is all puckered up. He holds up his bouquet] I brought you some flowers.
Sandy: [walks over] For me? How sweet. [grabs the flowers, but SpongeBob refuses to let go. She finally pries them loose and part of SpongeBob's pinky falls off. He closes his hand] You okay?
SpongeBob: [the black circles around his eyes are gone. His voice is now hoarse] Yes, I'm okay.
Sandy: You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit.
SpongeBob: I can’t imagine why.
Sandy: Can I get you anything?
SpongeBob: Water would be nice.
Sandy: I'm gonna to put these in a vase.
SpongeBob: Take your time. [Sandy goes in her tree and closes the door off-screen. SpongeBob hears it, he then gasps and stumbles toward the door and struggles to open it] I gotta get out of here! [screams and then thinks]
Sandy: [in SpongeBob's head] I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree.
[SpongeBob struggles even more]
Patrick: [in SpongeBob's head] When in doubt, pinky out.
SpongeBob: [lifts his pinky up and gets confidence and victorious music plays.] I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... [sits down, loses confidence again and the music stops]
Sandy: Why, these flowers are just beautiful! [sniffs] They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice cold water. [puts the vase down. SpongeBob is totally enticed by the water. Sandy sits down across from him] So tell me about yourself. [puts her hands under head feeling fascinated about SpongeBob sharing himself] It must be fascinating bein' a sea critter. [SpongeBob watches a drop of water drop down the side of the glass] SpongeBob? [a timer goes off] Oh, there's the cookies. [walks back into the tree] Be right back.
SpongeBob: [thinking] I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face. He's really shriveled now] I don't need it. [close-up of vase, then another one of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [close-up of vase] I don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [long pause, finally yelling] I NEED IT! [shoots up into the air, bounces off the ceiling and holds the vase.]
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
SpongeBob: [holds up his pinky and starts guzzling down the whole vase of water] I'm a quitter! [screams and runs around]
Patrick: [enters into the dome and slams the door shut] You can't leave now. You'll blow it.
SpongeBob: [muffled while hanging on the door] Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good.
Patrick: [grabs SpongeBob off the door] You're just being shy. [carries SpongeBob to the picnic table] Don't worry, buddy. You're doing fine. [starts getting weak] I won't let you blow... this. [drops SpongeBob and crawls on the floor, panting. He coughs and sputters, then stands up] What kind of place is this?! [runs toward the door and tries to open it] There's no water in here!
SpongeBob: [joins in on the door-opening struggle] I tried to tell you!
Patrick: We've gotta get out of here!
SpongeBob: You're... doing it... wrong...
Patrick: Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. [The two pass out.]
[fades to the sun]
Sandy: [walks out of the tree with tea and cookies] Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...
[She screams and drops her tray. On the grass is a live-action sponge and starfish. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill those helmets with water.]
Sandy: There, that oughta do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked. [carries over a tray with three tea glasses. Everyone takes one] I propose a toast, to new friends. [drinks it while SpongeBob and Patrick lift their drinks up and they clink the glasses on the helmets, causing them to spill] Hold on a second. [places a tea bag in each helmet, allowing the two to drink the tea water] I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up. [Patrick nudges SpongeBob and they both put their pinkies up. They sip the tea.]
All: Ahhh...
SpongeBob: [walks outside his house, and breathes in the fresh air] Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. [grabs wood, a hammer, and some nails, and starts to noisily build a stand. Squidward peeks his head out the window.]
Squidward: Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
Squidward: Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
SpongeBob: Okay. [taps on a nail lightly, and he looks up at Squidward's window. He does it again, and continues to, making sure he doesn't make too much noise. Meanwhile, in Squidward's house, Squidward has his clarinet in his hand.]
Squidward: And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you. [starts to play while SpongeBob looks up and sees that Squidward is playing, so he decides to finish his stand quickly. Squidward looks out the window again.]
Squidward: I thought I... Huh?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
Squidward: Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Uh huh.
Squidward: Oh, puh-lease. I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles? [Patrick comes out of his house, stuck to the underside of the rock]
Patrick: Good morning. [A TV, lamp, and chair is seen below Patrick's rock. Patrick falls off his rock, onto his furniture, and begins screaming)
Squidward: Oh, boy. [Patrick walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
Patrick: Hmm, how much is it?
SpongeBob: Only a quarter.
Patrick: Sounds reasonable. [whispering] Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Patrick. [pulls out a quarter and he gives it to Patrick]
Patrick: Ah, one quarter. [hands the quarter back to SpongeBob, and bites it to see if it's real]
SpongeBob: Thank you. [cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Hmm, business is booming. [laughs] How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh-huh. [continues playing. Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob dips the wand in the bubble soap]
SpongeBob: One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go. [Patrick grabs the wand from SpongeBob, inhales deeply and begins to blow, but a bubble doesn't come out. He pants and blows again. After a while, SpongeBob puts up a "Lessons" sign. Patrick then loses his breath] Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
Patrick: Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter? [SpongeBob hands Patrick a quarter] Thanks. [winks and hands the quarter back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique. [starts doing his infamous routine] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-around-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [blows bubbles shaped like ducks]
Patrick: Oooh. [SpongeBob pops out of nowhere and blows a box. Patrick giggles and SpongeBob blows a caterpillar] Ah! [The caterpillar then pops one-by-one, with descending sounds. Patrick continues to giggle. SpongeBob blows a tugboat, and it floats off, pops, and makes a foghorn noise. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house]
Squidward: Huh? [shakes his clarinet. Cut back to outside with SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: And now... with two hands! [inhales deeply and blows out an elephant. Circus music, in particular part of the piece "Entry of the Gladiators", starts playing.]
Patrick: [laughs] It's a giraffe! [Patrick continues laughing as the elephant floats over into Squidward's house. SpongeBob then worried as the bubble pops and tons of smaller bubbles come out of both windows of the house while an elephant sounds. Squidward opens the door with a sour look on his face. SpongeBob and Patrick hide behind the stand. SpongeBob places a "Closed" sign on it. Squidward looks over the stand]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
Squidward: Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
SpongeBob: We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art. Watch carefully. [does his infamous routine again] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-around-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [blows a butterfly, which flies over to Squidward, lands on his head, and pops]
Squidward: That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard. [SpongeBob and Patrick, now depressed, head to SpongeBob's house] You should be ashamed of yourselves. [SpongeBob closes the door as Squidward laughs to himself] Bubbles. [continues laughing] Art. [mumbles, and picks up the bubble wand, sniffs it, and inhales to blow. Then, SpongeBob pops up out of nowhere]
SpongeBob: That'll be 25 cents, sir.
Squidward: Ah, whoa, what? [SpongeBob blinks] Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
SpongeBob: We also offer lessons for beginners. [puts the "Lessons" sign up]
Squidward: Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble? [pulls a quarter out] Here's your 25 cents! [SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real and it bends] Watch and learn. [inhales and blows, but nothing happens] Uhh... wait, wait, wait. [he inhales and blows again, but nothing happens again] One more time. Here. Wait. [inhales and blows again, and a small bubble comes out and instantly falls to the ground and bursts, making a fart sound. Looks over at SpongeBob and Patrick. They gulp, and then start whistling. Squidward places another quarter on the stand] Uhh... Just a mere warm-up. [dips the wand in the bubble container, inhales deeply and blows hard. The bubble falls to the ground again, making another fart sound, gets another quarter out and puts it on the stand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, remember the technique. [Squidward keeps trying to blow bubbles while SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to show him the technique] Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back....
Patrick: Hey! Technique, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Spin around like thi— Like this... Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three...
Patrick: The pelvic woo!
SpongeBob: Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the "Woooooo!" Squidward?
Patrick: Listen to Sponge!
SpongeBob: Technique! Technique! Technique!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [while standing on one foot] Technique! Technique! Technique! Technique! Tech- [Squidward looks at them]
SpongeBob: [weakly] You're not doing the technique.
Patrick: Technique.
Squidward: Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique! [starts to do the infamous routine, while imitating SpongeBob] First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then... [screams very loudly into the wand, blowing a gargantuan, unshaped bubble]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [Squidward is then lifted off the ground. The bubble pops off the wand and Squidward falls back on the ground]
SpongeBob: All right, Squid. That was so good.
Patrick: Squid is number one.
Squidward: I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that.
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: Now that's a bubble.
SpongeBob: You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique.
Patrick: Yeah, technique.
Squidward: Technique? Hah. SpongeBob, you don't think I created that [kisses his tentacle] beautiful work of art with your help? [starts laughing] Come on, it's in my genes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes! [Squidward walks back to his house]
Squidward: Thank you, thank you, thank you. [starts to play his clarinet. SpongeBob and Patrick chant Squidward's name. At one point, they belly flop each other and Patrick falls on the ground.] I rock. [continues to play his clarinet. As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to chant, Squidward's bubble flies over them, covers Squidward's house, and pulls it out of the ground and up towards the top of the ocean. SpongeBob notices and stops Patrick]
SpongeBob: [concerned] Squidward! [Patrick now notices]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward stops playing his clarinet]
Squidward: Hello, my friends. You are looking at a... [sees how high he is from the sky]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
Squidward: ...genius. [the bubble explodes in the air and then the ground violently rumbles and shakes. SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [the ground stops shaking. The two slowly walk back to their homes. They then speed up and run inside their houses. Squidward's house floats back to the surface. Squidward starts playing his clarinet weakly as the screen cuts to black, ending the episode]
French Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me. But to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. [SpongeBob and Sandy sit enjoying the beach. SpongeBob sighs]
SpongeBob: What a great day. [runs off] Hey, Sandy! Look! [now covered in a mound of sand] I'm Sandy! [Sandy laughs. SpongeBob forms sand around his head and nose to look like Squidward and imitates his voice] Hey Sandy, who am I? [Sandy still laughs. SpongeBob picks up a sand phone] Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. [Sandy continues laughing]
Sandy: SpongeBob! [a doorbell rings, SpongeBob walks in carrying sand pizza boxes and wearing a Krusty Krab sand hat]
SpongeBob: Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? [he and Sandy laugh together. Larry walks up]
Larry the Lobster: Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hey, Larry.
Larry: You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy: Sure. [she and Larry walk off] Well, come on, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob's sand pizzas and hat fall flat as he walks on dejectedly]
SpongeBob: [disappointingly] Coming. [cut to a group of weightlifters, each grunting as they work out. Larry turns to Sandy]
Larry: Give it a try, Sandy. [Sandy stands in front of a weight. She picks it up, grunting as she does so. The crowd cheers for her, and she throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? [tries to walk off]
Larry: How about a little more weight? [bends down to pick up a weight heavier than Sandy's] Observe. [grunts as he picks it up, his eyes bulging, and veins stick out from his neck. The crowd cheers, and Larry throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: All right, stand back, everyone. [picks up a single twig from the ground. The crowd is silent. He sinks into the sand. Sandy walks to a weight]
Sandy: Y'all watch this! [picks up an anchor weight. The crowd cheers for her, but stop when they realize Larry has lifted the spectator stands] Way to go, Larry! [SpongeBob burrows into the sand, and tunnels over to Incidental 36 who is picnicking next to a marshmallow sack]
SpongeBob: Could I borrow a couple of these?
Incidental 36: [through his marshmallow-filled mouth] Mm-hmm. [crams another marshmallow into his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig] And now, with the addition of 2, count 'em, 2 marshmallows. [preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd gasps, then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing]
Scooter: That was too funny. [slaps SpongeBob on the back] You are hilarious!
Sandy: Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? [SpongeBob grins widely which gave him an idea. Cut to Larry with a volleyball on his claw]
Larry: Anybody up for some volleyball? [the ball volleys back and forth, until Larry spikes it into some fish and the crowd cheers for him. SpongeBob looks at him in contempt. A fish serves the ball and as Larry is about to hit it, SpongeBob interferes]
SpongeBob: I got it! [the ball falls and SpongeBob tries to serve it] Incoming! [the serve misses and the crowd boos. He bends down to pick the ball up and rips his pants] Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! [the crowd laughs. Scooter walks in laughing again]
Scooter: Once again, dude, [slaps SpongeBob on the back] you have split my sides! [he continues to laugh. Cut to a tossed Frisbee. Larry catches it and throws it to Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
Sandy: Okay, here it comes! [SpongeBob stands still and lets the Frisbee hit him on the head, knocking him over]
SpongeBob: I could use a hand here! [laughs. Sandy walks over and helps him up]
Sandy: You okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess so... [does a handstand, revealing his pants] ...except I ripped my pants! [the crowd laughs, and Scooter walks up to SpongeBob once again]
Scooter: You still got it, dude! [slaps SpongeBob on the back again. Cut to SpongeBob and Sandy walking to an ice cream vendor]
Incidental 39: May I help you?
SpongeBob: I'll take a banana split.
Incidental 39: Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob: That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? [Sandy giggles]
Incidental 39: [annoyed] Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob: How about ripple? [does so, Sandy giggles again] No, thanks, already got one! [Sandy drops laughing, Incidental 39 is unamused, and SpongeBob happily bounces off to a snack bar. SpongeBob runs up to Incidental 40, knocking his drink over] Is that a burger you're eating?
Incidental 40: Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: You know what would go good with that?
Incidental 40: No, what?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Ripped... pants. [smiles widely and shows the annoyed Incidental 40 his ripped pants. SpongeBob then runs around the snack bar, laughing. He comes up in-between two fish] Ripped pants a la mode! [rips his pants, the fish are annoyed. Cut to SpongeBob being in the kitchen of the snack bar, next to the fry cook] Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? [shoves his behind through the box, revealing his ripped pants, then laughs and the box is revealed to have no lower part. The fry cook groans disgustedly. Cut to a broadcasting booth over looking the lagoon]
Sports guy: Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon. [fish are surfing. Close-up of Perch Perkins] And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back. [cut to Larry lying on his surfboard] There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is. [cut to Sandy doing a handstand on her surfboard] There goes SpongeBob... [rip] ripping his pants again. [The sports guy is annoyed, then cut to SpongeBob ripping his pants on his surfboard. A wave knocks SpongeBob off his surfboard and washes him up on the beach]
Incidental 155: Hey, look! A cardboard box washed up on the beach. [takes a closer look through his telescope] Holy fish paste! It's a guy! [sprints over to SpongeBob and flips him over] Why?! Why?! WHY?! [a crowd gathers around SpongeBob and Incidental 155]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to Incidental 155] Come closer. [a divine light shines on him] I need... I need...
Incidental 155: What do you need? [tears come to Incidental 155's and Sandy's eyes]
SpongeBob: [pats Incidental 155 on the shoulder. Close up of SpongeBob's mouth] A tailor. [the light turns off, accompanied by a light switch] Because I ripped my pants! [laughs. Incidental 155 makes an annoyed expression, drops SpongeBob, and the crowd surrounding him walks off with annoyance. SpongeBob is left alone and Sandy walks up to him angry]
Sandy: That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick! [walks off as Scooter walks towards SpongeBob and looks at him sadly]
Scooter: [shakes his head] Dude... [walks off. Cut to a dressing tent, with SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting. [speaking] Let's see... [checking them off a list] "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," [uses his pencil to write the word "NO" and circle it] No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody! [runs out of the dressing tent] Not ripped pants! [tears his pants off] Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose! [the wind howls, SpongeBob standing alone on the beach. A tumbleweed rolls by. SpongeBob turns and hears party music at a distance, and sees Larry and Sandy playing volleyball] Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. [lies on the beach as he continues saying, no] We blew it, pants. [throws his pants aside]
Pants: What do you mean, "we?" [the pants walk off, leaving SpongeBob alone]
SpongeBob: Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! [Incidental 22 walks up to SpongeBob, shining red]
Incidental 22: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. [places a fin on herself, and it leaves a sounding mark, which vanishes]
SpongeBob: Ouch. [a fish walks up to the two]
Loser: No, I am. I got sand in my buns. [shows them two sandy hamburger buns. There is a rumbling coming from the sand and a whale pops his head out of the sand]
Frank: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I lost my best friend.
All: How? [SpongeBob grabs a sand guitar and sings he is front of the sand castle and a sand telephone he built earlier]
SpongeBob: When I ripped... [his underwear starts ripping] my pants. [starts to sing] I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, [The curtain comes down and a spotlight shines on Spongebob] all just because I [rips his underwear again] ripped my pants. [the other three "losers of the beach" assemble on a sand stage with sand instruments and sing]
All: ♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and [Incidental 22 turns around and suddenly, her bottom then rips, splitting open, revealing her white underwear] ripped his pants!♪
SpongeBob: [singing voice, a crowd begins to gather] ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
All: ♪Or sand in your buns!♪ [instrumental break. The loser scrapes the two buns together to make a rhythm then the curtain shows waves crashing about]
SpongeBob: ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ [the whole group comes together one by one in sync with the music and they rip their pants. By now, a huge crowd has gathered and is cheering the group onstage. A blimp flies by with SpongeBob's name on it. It's revealed that SpongeBob and his band were having a concert.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy! [she gets onstage and hugs SpongeBob. He returns the embrace]
Sandy: Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. [Larry walks up]
Larry: [impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. [hands SpongeBob a pencil] Would you... sign my pants?
SpongeBob: Absolutely, buddy. [SpongeBob bends down to sign Larry's pants. His underwear then rips off completely, leaving SpongeBob "au naturel." Someone off-screen whistles. SpongeBob covers his crotch, grins, and blushes sheepishly]
Narrator: Ah, ze early morning in Bikini Bottom, when the jellyfish are buzzing about and making their jellyfish jelly. [A jellyfish flies by SpongeBob's house. Just then a giant periscope comes out of the porthole] Oh, what is happening here? [SpongeBob is looking through the periscope from inside, Patrick waits behind him] Collectors? [SpongeBob nods to Patrick. They both run toward two vents: one square shaped, one circular shaped. SpongeBob takes the square one and Patrick takes the circle one. The two approach ropes and slide down them. At the bottom, they encounter a case of rope burn and jump around frantically. They blow their hands to remove the burn. Once the burn is gone, the two get serious again and approach a closet. It houses three sets of poles and three sets of nets. SpongeBob and Patrick take one of each, connect them and test their mobility. SpongeBob puts on his glasses and the two seriously step out ready for action. A jellyfish flies by and the two joyfully sing and follow it]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] I think I've got it! Wait a minute... [we hear jellyfish stings and SpongeBob and Patrick screaming. The two run back the way they came, being chased by the jellyfish. They fall into a heap in front of Squidward's house. The jellyfish stings both of their backsides and flies off. Just then, Squidward comes out of his house with his bike]
Squidward: Hm.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, we're jellyfishing.
Squidward: Of course you are. Bye now. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Wait! We made a net especially for you! [holds it up] Do you want to come with us?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Really? Jellyfishing with you guys? Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book! I would love to go jellyfishing! I can't think of anything I'd like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends: SpongeBob and... uh...
Patrick: Patrick.
Squidward: Right. But I can't. Bye bye.
SpongeBob: Next time?
Squidward: Oh sure, right! Whatever. [bikes away; under breath] Like that'll ever happen.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun.
Patrick: Maybe he doesn't like us.
SpongeBob: No, are you kidding? We're his best friends. [Squidward bikes down a path, chuckling to himself]
Squidward: Jellyfishing. [as he laughs, his nose inflates and deflates] Oh, I'll go. [laughs] I sure had them going. [laughs. But, he doesn't see a jellyfish which is going in the opposite direction. He keeps on laughing. The jellyfish ends up swimming in Squidward's mouth and he coughs it out] Stupid jellyfish! Beat it! [He hits it, and the jellyfish goes up his shirt and starts zapping him, causing Squidward to veer out of control. His tentacles get tangled on the pedals and he trips on a rock. He bounces down a hill and then falls down a jagged rocky cliff. He reaches the bottom of the cliff and immediately an atomic explosion appears.] Ow...
[Cut to SpongeBob sitting at his house. He looks out the window. But, no one is there. He sits down again. He notices a photo of him and an unhappy Squidward that reads, "Friends." He puts it down and looks out the window again. Squidward, who's in a wheelchair and all bandaged up rolls down the path]
SpongeBob: Squid's back! [phones Patrick, which causes the screen to split diagonally, revealing Patrick on the bottom]
Patrick: Yello?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!
Patrick: Oh, great! Who are they? [it's revealed that the two are phoning each other from across the room, just with different wallpapers]
SpongeBob: Us! [the two hang up] Let's go! [Squidward wheels himself into his house. The lights suddenly turn on, and party horns can be heard. SpongeBob and Patrick are inside his house with a banner that says "Welcome Home"] Welcome home, Squidward!
Patrick: Merry Christmas!
SpongeBob: We're gonna make this your best day ever! [Squidward turns around and wheels out. SpongeBob rolls him back in] Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there. [SpongeBob wheels Squidward to a table where Patrick stands by a bowl of soup]
Patrick: How about some soup on your best day ever? [Squidward looks at the soup and sees condensed Alphabet Soup letters spelling out, "Best Day Ever" Patrick holds up a spoon] Here we go! [scoops some up, but Squidward makes some grunting noises in refusal] Oh, it's a little hot. [blows on the spoon, sending steaming hot soup splashing all over Squidward's bandaged face. Patrick notices his spoon is empty and refills it to blow on, covering Squidward in more hot soup. This continues for three times until SpongeBob pulls the soup bowl away and laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever. [walks near a music stand and Squidward's clarinet] How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet. [blows into it, but wind comes out causing Squidward to groan] Sorry, my lips are a little dry. [wets his lips exaggeratedly long and wet. Just when he prepares to blow, a disgusted Patrick snatches the clarinet away]
Patrick: Music isn't best either!
SpongeBob: But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever! [cut to SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward in Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob and Patrick hold nets]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [chanting] Jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing!
SpongeBob: This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured. [Squidward rides away, but SpongeBob catches him] No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen.
Patrick: Firmly grasp it in your hand. [places the pole end on Squidward's bandaged hand, but it falls because he can't grab, Patrick picks it up] Firmly grasp it. [does it again and the results are the same. Patrick gets frustrated] Firmly grasp it. [forcefully jabs the net through Squidward's bandaged hand. Squidward lets out a muffled pained scream] That ought to do it. [SpongeBob spots a jellyfish]
SpongeBob: There's one in position. Ready... set... go! [the two yell out words of encouragement to Squidward and jump up and down, but Squidward isn't budging. The two eventually notice Squidward isn't going anywhere. They again encourage him, but still nothing happens]
Patrick: I think we gotta show him how it's done. [in the tune of "The Beautiful Blue Danube," SpongeBob and Patrick dance along next to the jellyfish and try to catch it. SpongeBob and Patrick sing, and even the jellyfish hums out some music. After several attempts, they get into a big fight with stinging and such. The jellyfish escapes the squabbles and swims by Squidward and stings him on the nose. Squidward, mad, goes after the jellyfish. SpongeBob and Patrick, still getting stung by jellyfish, notice]
SpongeBob: Hey, look! Squid's doing it! [as Squidward chases, SpongeBob and Patrick cheer him on. His wheelchair is stopped by a rock, but he eventually gets back on track. The jellyfish lands on a pink "rock" and Squidward catches it. He laughs triumphantly, but muffled due to the bandages and whacks the net against the "rock". The "rock" surfaces, revealing to be a really huge jellyfish--the Queen Jellyfish. She now floats above Squidward. Squidward gulps. SpongeBob and Patrick look on.]
Patrick: This guy's good.
SpongeBob: He's a natural!
[SpongeBob and Patrick start simultaneously cheering Squidward on as he tries to get away from the Queen Jellyfish.]
Patrick: Yeah, you got it, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Yeah, you're doing great! Go, Squid, go!
Patrick: Yeah, you're doing it, Squid! See what you've been missing?!
SpongeBob: Yeah, you got, Squid!
Patrick: You got what you wanted, Squidward! You can go that distance! Use that net!
SpongeBob: Be the net!
Patrick: Yeah! You're feeling it, Squid! That's it, all the way! The last 6 miles, make that, Squid! Go, go, go!
SpongeBob: Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now!
Patrick: It's in the bag!
SpongeBob: This is really your best day ever, isn't it?
[The Queen Jellyfish gives Squidward an extremely powerful sting. SpongeBob and Patrick stop cheering.]
Both: Oooh...
[Cut to the next day where SpongeBob and Patrick walking in front of Squidward's place covered in bandages]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Well... [sighs] Thought yesterday went... [hesitates] pretty well, don't you think?
Patrick: I had fun.
SpongeBob: Me too. [some whirring is heard in the background]
Patrick: Here comes Squidward!
SpongeBob: Oh, great. [Squidward approaches in a stretcher] Hey, Squid! How about that... [Squidward rolls down the front walk in a wheeled medical bed with a container of life-saving fluid and in a full body cast.] ...best day ever?
Patrick: There's always tomorrow! [Squidward's bed bangs on the door, trying to get in]
SpongeBob: Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward. [bangs the door again] Um, we got you a present! [it's the jellyfish that caused Squidward to encounter the Queen Jellyfish in a jar] It's the jellyfish. [Squidward scowls]
Patrick: You know, from yesterday!
SpongeBob: You're not still mad, are you? [Squidward opens the jar in SpongeBob and Patrick's direction]
Patrick: Yup, he's still mad. [The jellyfish chases after SpongeBob and Patrick and stings them repeatedly as they run into the distance. Squidward laughs to himself, his nose inflating and deflating again. The Queen Jellyfish returns and zaps him again. Now he's burnt to a crisp. The cast cracks off in pieces, leaving a completely blackened Squidward]
Squidward: Ow.
Squidward: [from inside] One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day. [cut to inside of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [speaking in French accent] Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. [flips it up in the air and it falls into one of his holes. He holds up the other ingredients]
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Next, les ingredients. [throws them in the air] Ah, oui! [catches them in his holes and his pants] Les mustard. [squirts some mustard out and it lands in his eye]
Squidward: Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Les hold on a second! [takes his head and shakes it all up. When he puts it back on his body, his eyes roll around] And...voilá. [goes up to Squidward and pulls a Krabby Patty from under his nose; speaking in normal voice] It's under your nose! [laughs and puts it on a plate. Squidward pretends to laugh]
Squidward: You're killing me, SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. [Close-up on the patty].
SpongeBob: Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
Squidward: Okay, give it to me. [the Krabby Patty flies off of the plate and starts bouncing all over the place] Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
SpongeBob: I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! [The patty slithers out the door and heads for the exit. Mr. Krabs spears it with his leg. A tiny thing comes out from it and Krabs inspects it with a magnifying glass.]
Mr. Krabs: Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is... [view of in the magnifying glass, of a tiny jelly bean-shaped green creature with one eye] Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Sheldon J. Plankton: Hear me, Krabs! When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business! I went to college! [Mr. Krabs picks up the puny pest] Hey! Let me go!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer! [laughs, then splats Plankton on a plate and spins him back across the street, to the Chum Bucket] Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Plankton: You'll pay for this, Krabs! [slams through the doors]
SpongeBob: Uh... Plankton, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug? [laughs. SpongeBob joins in, braying with laughter. Krabs stops, but SpongeBob keeps laughing] Okay. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Enough, lad, it wasn't that funny. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Get back to work! [SpongeBob stops laughing. Cut to nighttime at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [from inside] Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs: Good night, me boy! [SpongeBob walks out and walks past the Chum Bucket contently]
Plankton: [unseen] Psst... young man. [SpongeBob looks around to see where this voice came from] Yes, over here. Come on, boy, a little closer. [SpongeBob walks forward] Closer... [SpongeBob walks] Not that close! [a crunching sound is heard. SpongeBob lifts up his shoe revealing a squished Plankton] You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi.
SpongeBob: Plankton? [SpongeBob peels Plankton off his shoe and onto his hand]
Plankton: Ouch!
SpongeBob: What do you want?
Plankton: I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
SpongeBob: Um... no.
Plankton: Acquaintances?
SpongeBob: No.
Plankton: [beat] Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
SpongeBob: I... guess so.
Plankton: You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment. [rummages through his back pocket and takes out a golden spatula] Ching! [in unison with the sparkling of the spatula] Sparkle, sparkle.
SpongeBob: Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.
Plankton: It's a gift! A gift from a friend. [hugs SpongeBob's thumb] Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday. [puts a birthday hat on his head and SpongeBob's thumb and then blows a noisemaker. He then takes out a cake] And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? [blows out the candles].
SpongeBob: A booster seat? [Plankton takes off the hat and throws out the cake]
Plankton: Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those [starts to drool] tender... delicious... Krabby Patties! [SpongeBob drops Plankton and gasps]
SpongeBob: You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow!
Plankton: Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
SpongeBob: You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me! [walks off, then stops] Even if we are friends! [runs off] Never, never, never, never!
Plankton: Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! [takes out a gramophone that plays evil music and laughs evilly to it. Cut to SpongeBob's bedroom, where SpongeBob goes to sleep]
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [Gary meows. SpongeBob goes to sleep. Just then, one of the flowers on SpongeBob's bed pattern pops up. It's Plankton in disguise, wearing a backpack that looks more like an antenna-like machine.]
Plankton: [chuckling] SpongeBob, you will be mine! [pulls out the record player and laughs evilly to it, but it actually plays a children's song of the A-B-C's.]
Woman in the recording: ♪Letters of the alphabet, A-B-C...♪
[Plankton immediately realizes this and flips the record around on the other side. It plays the evil music like last time and he laughs. Then he walks through one of SpongeBob's holes and begins his journey. Plankton reads a map that looks like a regular road map, except with a giant brain in the middle of it.]
Plankton: It should be in here... but where? [pan out to reveal he's standing on the brain] Where? Oh... [takes off the antenna thing on his back] This will be the beginning of the end! [outside, SpongeBob rolls to his left in his sleep. The brain falls to the right inside and Plankton falls off] Ouch! Stupid brain... [gives chase] Come back here, you swine! [SpongeBob then rolls to his right. Inside, the brain squishes Plankton. SpongeBob then sleeps on his back and the brain stops rolling. Plankton holds up a roll of duct tape] That's it, brain, you're going down! [Plankton uses tape to hold it down] Yes, yes, that's grand. [takes out blueprints] And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan. [the blueprints reveal a picture of the antenna thing labeled "Control" and an arrow pointing to a picture of a brain labeled "Brain." Plankton follows these instructions by jamming the control in the brain] And now, it's time for a little wakey-uppy. [his hands on the control levers, he uses his foot to press the "Total Control" button. Outside, SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Morning already? [Plankton jams the controls causing SpongeBob's legs to jam out to his side. He rumbles and falls down. Plankton laughs evilly] I... I feel a little funny today. [using the controls, he makes SpongeBob walk. Plankton laughs]
Plankton: I have you now! [outside, SpongeBob keeps walking towards the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Time for a well-balanced breakfast. [rams through the wall and through his refrigerator, emerging with bread, a bottle of milk, and an egg carton on his head] This isn't what I had in mind. [walks towards the straps with his pants attached] Let me just grab my pants. [walks toward them and they spring him. He eventually gives free and keeps walking] I guess I'm not wearing any pants today. [crashes through the side of the wall] I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess. [Gary meows] You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! [inside Squidward's house, he tries to sleep. Off-screen] Squidward! Help!
Squidward: Be quiet, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob bursts through the wall of Squidward's bedroom]
SpongeBob: Help!
Squidward: SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad? [SpongeBob crashes through the opposite wall. He stops walking and his head turns around 180 degrees]
Plankton: [through SpongeBob] Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
Squidward: Mediocre? [from inside, Plankton speaks through a microphone]
Plankton: You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste! [SpongeBob snaps out of it]
SpongeBob: Something must be wrong with my brain! [his eyes roll into the back of his head and he sees Plankton and gasps] Plankton! [Plankton raises his eyebrow] What kind of friend are you?
Plankton: Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! [from outside]
SpongeBob: Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!
Plankton: Never! Never! [laughs and SpongeBob walks out backwards. Squidward turns pale faints. SpongeBob crashes through Patrick's rock and reemerges with Patrick sleeping on his head. SpongeBob throws him off and he's pinned into the ground. SpongeBob walks toward the Krusty Krab. Inside SpongeBob] Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
SpongeBob: No! No, never! [crashes through it, reemerging with a Krabby Patty. Plankton laughs evilly] You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty formula! [walks into the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
SpongeBob: No, no, no! [they're inside and walk through a door] There's no one here.
Plankton: Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab! [the room he's walked into has a screen with a live-action Labrador Retriever. The dog barks. They walk into the next room, a real lab] And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? [pulls the record out again and it plays dramatic music and laughs]
SpongeBob: I must fight! [mumbles nonsensically, stretches his head out, and bites against the side of the door. His body keeps trying to walk.]
Plankton: No, no, no, no. [pushes the levers forward, which causes SpongeBob to lose grip and slam against the wall and wobble over to a giant funnel thing] There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. [A robot arm clenching some seaweed comes in and drops it in the giant funnel analyzer. It has zapped and some beeping is heard from the giant computer screen. The screen, then reads what the computer says.]
Karen Plankton: Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed. [a picture of the seaweed appears]
Plankton: Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula. [laughs and pulls the lever forward, letting two of SpongeBob's fingers off the patty. He's holding it with both hands, so one finger from each hand] And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty. [two more fingers loose grip] This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants? [SpongeBob tries to resist, but stops]
SpongeBob: I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down. [tears start to come out of his eyes] I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, [one of his teary eyes twinkle] you delicate little Krabby Patty.
Plankton: Mmm...
SpongeBob: [tearing up even more] With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. [inside, Plankton starts to get hungry]
Plankton: Steamy... [a live-action patty gets assembled on screen as SpongeBob states the ingredients]
SpongeBob: I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. [inside, Plankton starts to drool excessively]
Plankton: Yes... yes... yes! [jumps out of one of SpongeBob's holes to the patty] Come to papa! [bounces off the patty and lands in the analyzer] Oh, boy... [now zapped and the computer reads out the analysis]
Karen: Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas. [Plankton appears on the screen]
Plankton: Well, this stinks.
SpongeBob: Well, patty, I guess we can go home now. [walks out]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty! [SpongeBob walks out the swivel doors and they go back and forth] Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty! [the doors come to a close] Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.
Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. [blows kiss] Congratulations, chef! [gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo with his hairpiece and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops.]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick.
[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops.]
Patrick Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, notices a liquid coming from his soufflé, pours it into a bowl and starts rapidly stirring the liquid with a fork until it becomes bubbly. Meanwhile, outside, Spongebob whispers into another bubble]
SpongeBob: [whispering into bubble] Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
[The scene cuts to Squidward's back window as he finishes stirring the liquid, and blows a bubble with it through the fork. Squidward's bubble is approached by SpongeBob's bubble, grows a leg, and kicks SpongeBob's bubble, thus popping it. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops.]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [whispering into the bubble] Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. [the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. [another bubble comes over and pops] Yellow is ugly! [two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [talks into the bubble, puzzled] Patrick, what are you talking about?
[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. [SpongeBob gasps] You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
[Squidward chuckles. Another bubble floats over to Patrick]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick: [stands up and yells at SpongeBob] Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: [stands up and yells at Patrick] Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick: Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob: What's that? [Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé]
Patrick: It's what you are!
[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.]
SpongeBob: Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick: Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! [goes inside through the back door and turns around] Aww, tartar sauce! [shuts the door]
[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ]
Squidward: [laughs at Patrick, puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth and continues laughing, and moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it and chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters "K" and "O" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appear. Squidward passes out and drools]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you're choking! [runs over to Squidward] Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. [takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! [shakes Patrick's hands]
Patrick: Friend? [holds Squidward] Friend...
Squidward: [uneasily] Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... [steps back] just friends. [they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare]
Patrick: So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? [walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head]
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? [Gary is sleeping inside his shell] Gary? [knocks on his shell]
[cut to Squidward's]
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: [sitting on a bench while clapping] Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! [Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! [holds up three fingers] Uhh... [draws faces on each finger with a broken smile] The gang's all here... [looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears] Ohhh!
[Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out]
Squidward: Ow! Oh! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob: [sees Squidward in pain] Oh, boy, now's my chance! [jumps out of the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: [running] Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I'll save you! [rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath]
Squidward: [tries to get to his door] No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob: [jumps off a diving board] Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! [screams as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place] Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! [SpongeBob smiles big]
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. [Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head] So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! [takes one from the wall] Give me an A, buddy! [Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings] Squidward is my best friend in the world. [grates strings with bow] Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee]
SpongeBob: [now playing with his fingers like a guitar] Squidward...
Patrick: [pops in through the window] Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. [SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face] Oh!
SpongeBob: [strums harder before slamming the bass to the floor] And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! [smashes the bass] Umm, I can fix this. [Squidward is steaming red in fury]
Squidward: Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! [kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. [opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. [shows him a brush and soap]
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! [SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? [notices Patrick in the bath-tub] Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... [shown bath toys] ...rubber bath toys!
Patrick: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously] You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
Squidward: [screams] This can't be happening to me! [runs away while SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
SpongeBob: Buddy!
Patrick: Squidward, where are you?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: [hiding in a trash can] Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!
SpongeBob: [reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it] Squidward. [opens it] A dinner party? I'd love to! [knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it] Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. [shuts the door]
SpongeBob: I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... [gasps when he sees Patrick] Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: [takes out a bottle of soda] Well, how about some soda, guys? [SpongeBob shows him his glass]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! [Squidward gives him some soda] Thanks, friend. [flicks Squidward's nose and drinks]
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? [SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! [drinks]
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! [pours SpongeBob another glass]
Patrick: I still didn't get any! [SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda]
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! [Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast]
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward! [shows Squidward his glass again, but it's still full] Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick! Your glass is full!
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both show Squidward their glasses] Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: No! Out! [both walk out]
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he's jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]
Squidward: Ohhhhh, my back.
[SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: This is it, Gary!
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words "boating exam today!" on it then drops to the floor]
SpongeBob: The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Squidward! [rides his unicycle around Squidward's house]
Squidward: Ready to move?
SpongeBob: No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. [rides his unicycle towards the school] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it] I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the unicycle into the dumpster] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Incidental 27: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!
SpongeBob: [snaps his fingers] Hey, I'm getting mine next!
Incidental 27: Hey, I doubt it! [walks off]
SpongeBob: Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. [jumps around the boardwalk. Camera goes inside the school, as a female pufferfish looks out the window and sees SpongeBob jumping around.]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
Mrs. Puff: [with a clipboard and a pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Mrs. Puff: I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
SpongeBob: The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: What is the back?
SpongeBob: Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: #3: Right is...
SpongeBob: Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers]
Mrs. Puff: You've passed the oral test. [sarcastically] What a surprise. [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already?
Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in and closes his eyes with a smile]
Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track.
[SpongeBob's eyes spring open in awe; he looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer in delusion]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924...?
Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to start the boat. [turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
SpongeBob: The boat?
Mrs. Puff: Okay, now what do you do next?
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Floor it?!
Mrs. Puff: No, no, don't, don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Okay, floor it! [SpongeBob slams on the accelerator and starts driving backwards really fast]
Mrs. Puff: No! No, no, no, nooooo!!! [the boat whizzes by some spectators before crashing into a lighthouse. After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates to three times her size. The lighthouse falls, and Mrs. Puff speaks with a deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why?
Fred: My leg...!
SpongeBob: [in his bed at night] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it 37 times.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, 38. [puts his pillow on his head]
Gary: [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not walking.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is Star Ranger, over.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [opens the closet door, revealing Patrick wearing SpongeBob's clothes]
Patrick: Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about.
Patrick: What's the problem?
SpongeBob: I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it 37...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: ...uhh, 38 times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie]
SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top]
Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window]
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! [loudly] Testing! [screams] Test, test. Do you read?!
SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on. [focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and on the ground on all fours and starts chewing grass like a cow]
SpongeBob: Moo.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. An ambulance arrives with its siren on and drops off Mrs. Puff] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple]
SpongeBob: Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows]
Mrs. Puff: Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection]
SpongeBob: [starts to get scared] Uhh...
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob starts the boat. The engine starting up causes Mrs. Puff to go crazy]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob: It's okay, it's only the boat.
Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob: I... I think so.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive.
SpongeBob: Put it in drive?
Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive. Then what?
SpongeBob: [lifts leg up] Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: No! [screams] No!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Freeze, mister! [SpongeBob stops] Big toe. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [a giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve]
Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Left. [SpongeBob turns left]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Right. [SpongeBob turns right]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine.
Montage: [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.]
Mrs. Puff: Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs again] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs a third time] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating.
[SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating; only Patrick laughs]
Patrick: Cheating! [laughing hysterically]
SpongeBob: I'm cheating?! Mrs Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil?
SpongeBob: I think I'm cheating.
Mrs. Puff: What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff]
SpongeBob: I think I am cheating!
Mrs. Puff: You've... you've let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows the antenna under his hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
Patrick: What?! [runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Mrs. Puff: [panicking] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel...
SpongeBob: Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
Mrs. Puff: No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way!
SpongeBob: No... I'm cheating...!
Mrs. Puff: At least, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Cheating!
Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
Mrs. Puff: It's okay to cheat today!
SpongeBob: No...!
Mrs. Puff: That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: Cheater...! [crashes offscreen head-on into the same lighthouse. Mrs. Puff inflates with a look of despair. The lighthouse falls yet again]
Mrs. Puff: [deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Fred: My leg! [some time later, EMTs are wheeling a still-inflated Mrs. Puff away on a gurney]
SpongeBob: Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: [normal voice] It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff cries as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike.
Gary: [with SpongeBob's unicycle] Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike with Gary on his head] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!
Squidward: [The scene starts at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table] Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!
[phone rings]
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming. [leaps for the phone, but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims]
Squidward: Hello? Sorry, sir, we're closed... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? [eyes turn into dollar signs] Um... Of course we have pizza.
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver.
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver, [gives Squidward the pizza] but you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big]
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says "I Brake For Sea Urchins"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!
Squidward: Good, then you drive.[tosses his hat away]
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Squidward: Back... it up.
SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay!
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse. [SpongeBob imagines the words "FORWARD" and "BACKWARD" turning into Korean characters, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (BACKWARD)]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: [shifts gears] Backing up! Backing up! [boat backs up really fast]
Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [they go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The next morning, the boat goes over five hills] Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. [boat stops with no fuel left] Backing up.
Squidward: Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! [kicks boat and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them]
SpongeBob: Well, we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: [singing] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...And my feet are killing me. Whoa. [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] Whee... eee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon]
Swordfish trucker: Crashin' frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck]
Squidward: He's stopping! He's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza [The wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth.] is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer!
Squidward: Who cares about the customer?!
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again]
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza! [lifts up into the tornado]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Where's the road? [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points]
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep.
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me! [later] Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside. [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral. [Squidward spits out the coral] Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer.
Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box]
SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine.
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.
SpongeBob: [entranced] Yeah...
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Oh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: [snaps out of it] Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward. [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away! [runs off]
Squidward: [chases SpongeBob] Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait! [he becomes too tired to run]
SpongeBob: No! No! [runs into Squidward]
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
Squidward: Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder. [sniff] It's a rock. [cries] A rock! A rock! It's a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!
SpongeBob: [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer’s face! [rings doorbell]
Customer: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Customer: Wow, thanks! I've been dying for one of these. It... [he frowns, brief pause] Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: [confused] What drink?
Customer: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: [checks through the order, and sees no drink listed.] But, you didn't order any...
Customer: [yelling furiously] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!
SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
Customer: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza box at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well, I ain't buying!! [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [SpongeBob continues sobbing. Squidward becomes furious. He grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door]
Customer: [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!
Squidward: [Customer's point of view] Well, this one's on the House! [brutally slams the pizza box in the customer's face]
SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind?
Squidward: [smugly] He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink?
Squidward: Nah. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work. [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Work? [screen cuts to black] Oh, my aching tentacles!
Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking. [continue to repeat "walking"]
Nematode #1: Hungry!
Nematodes: Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. [continue to repeat "hungry." All eat a whole large piece of coral]
Nematode #1: Still hungry!
Nematodes: Still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry. [continue to repeat "still hungry." All eat a truck that drives by, leaving the driver floating]
Fred: Aw, dang nematodes!
Nematode #1: Thirsty!
Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. [continue to repeat "thirsty." They all bounce to SpongeBob's house and take out some straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as various items in the bedroom shrink out of existence, including Gary's food bowl]
Gary: Meow. [The rest of the room begins to shrink as SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge! [The room shrinks again, and the bed disappears, leaving SpongeBob on the floor]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute! [cut to the outside, where the nematodes are still drinking the pineapple] Oh no! [SpongeBob runs into the living room. He squeezes through the door and gets launched into the wall. Gary gets stuck in the door as he slithers in]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob crashes into the wall, flipping the side table over. The phone lands on his lap] Ow. The shell phone! I know. [while quickly dialing] I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do.
Squidward: [on the other line] Hello?
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
SpongeBob: Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking, I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and [cut back to Squidward in his bed. SpongeBob's voice sounds fast and high-pitched] smaller and the walls are closing in on me, Squidward, Gary is terrified too! [SpongeBob's phone disappears, and the phone call is disconnected] Oh no!
Squidward: Yep, it is. [SpongeBob screams]
Patrick: [comes out from his rock] Is it time already to ruin Squid's day? [peels off his rock and falls on his furniture, then jumps out with a tuxedo and top hat on] Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Nematodes: [continue sucking on SpongeBob's house, then they all burp and leave]
SpongeBob: Ohh... nematodes. [sees a seed on the ground, then picks it up] The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. [Patrick and Squidward walk up]
Squidward: What's going on here?
SpongeBob: I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! [sadly] It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
Squidward: [smiling] Yeah...
Patrick: [his eyes bulge excessively in surprise] Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squidward: Well, what can I say? [begins to shake SpongeBob's hand] It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. [walks back to his house as he continues talking sarcastically] I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he celebrates] Boo-hoo! [starts to laugh]
Patrick: Squid's taking it real hard. What are you gonna do now?
SpongeBob: I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. [shown a picture of SpongeBob's parents smiling]
Patrick: No, wait a minute, no you don't. [shown picture of SpongeBob's parents frowning] We can build you a new house!
SpongeBob: We can't build a house!
Patrick: Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! [the antenna on Patrick's rock falls off]
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! [zoom in on SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers]
Patrick: [Patrick tries to hit a nail into a board, but hits his hand instead] Ow! Ow! Ow! [SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say "Ow!" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. Next, shown SpongeBob's finished house, shown also with sparkles]
Patrick: [Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb] We're done!
SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's built house sparkles a bit] I wish I lived there.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob puts the small pineapple on his head]
SpongeBob: One bedroom. [nose sticks out through the door and the pineapple breaks into pieces]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob: [pets Gary] Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
Patrick: Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
SpongeBob: That'd be great!
Patrick: Yeah! We'll be rockmates! [SpongeBob and Patrick get ready to sleep under Patrick's rock] Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, rockmate.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob goes to sleep but then is awaken to Patrick's snoring] Oh...what the...? [Gary hides in his shell and SpongeBob puts a cork in each side of his head, and goes back to sleep. The wind blows and Patrick shivers, he then pulls the rock closer to him, SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as they keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles, then spits out the cork]
Patrick: [lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it in his sleep several times] Oh! Spiders! Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Get 'em off, off me! Off, off, off! [he then goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! No, Patrick! No, wake up! No, wake up! No, it's me! I'm SpongeBob! [moves out of the rock and away from it a few feet and goes back to sleep]
Patrick: Spiders! Spiders! [picks up his rock, runs over to SpongeBob, and smashes him repeatedly with the rock] Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Patrick goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: [shivers, in Squidward's house, he stands next to Squidward, holding Gary, as Squidward sleeps, he taps Squidward's nose as he whispers] Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] H-h-huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] Whoa. Huh? Wha-what?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. [gets in bed with Squidward] Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, oh, yeah, sure. [scoots over to the side]
SpongeBob: While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Squidward: [sleepily] Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. [Sleepily talks a bit, gets out of bed and walks off, then comes back with a glass of water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. [Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass] Thanks, buddy.
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. [SpongeBob drinks the water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Squidward: [sleepily] Yeah. Me, too.
SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [yawns] Good night, SpongeBob. [Squidward's eyes pop open. Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Gary walk out] [unhappy] Good night, SpongeBob. [night turns to day then rooster crows to wake everyone up. Squidward opens his eyes excitedly] Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late! [he flies into his closet, gets dressed, and goes outside] Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand outside, with bags] I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
Squidward: Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. [changes his smile to a frown briefly] Please.
SpongeBob: Here come my parents. [Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds as SpongeBob's parents drive up]
Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mom.
Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. [picks up the bags and carries them to the car]
SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. [walks back to where his house used to be] I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. [buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be] You hold too many memories. [as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand] Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. [walks away]
Squidward: Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. [dances] Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. [Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the car]
Mrs. Squarepants: Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. [Patrick holds onto the back of the boat, lifting the front into the air, as he cries]
Squidward: [still dancing] SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving! [the seed shakes violently] La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha! [the seed shakes even more violently] He leaving, ha ha! [seed still shakes, then it sprouts three roots] SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! [Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. Squidward stops dancing, while SpongeBob, his parents and Patrick stare, bemused. A giant green stem grows out of the ground, SpongeBob's house grows from the plant and drops where his old house used to be and on Squidward. The stem then goes back into the ground]
SpongeBob: My house is back! [SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple] Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! [continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house. SpongeBob returns to Squidward lying under the floor] Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
Squidward: [muffled] Forever?
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil.
Clam Head Candy Cad: [holds a baby's lollipop and he spots the whirlpool] Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool! [the whirlpool catches him and the lollipop falls on the baby's tongue]
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man! Champion of the deep.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both watching the TV, excitedly] Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
SpongeBob: [dressed up as Mermaid Man] Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
Patrick: [dressed up as Barnacle Boy] Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man! I'm right behind you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick come outside and sneak behind Squidward, who's relaxing on a lounge chair wearing sunglasses.]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spotted their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
Squidward: SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You know what this means. [pulls out a box of donuts]
Patrick: Donuts.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooohh. [Both of them take one donut each, and put them on their fingers like rings.]
SpongeBob: By the power of Neptune. [Patrick bites into his donut]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! [both go into deep thinking] Think... harder... Barnacle Boy. [a jellyfish swims by] Here they come. [Squidward blows the jellyfish away]
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful. [he and Patrick set up a tent over Squidward]
Squidward: What the? [groans angrily]
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
[Cut to Squidward destroying the tent in a fury]
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man. [SpongeBob and Patrick run back to the Pineapple, closing the door behind them.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! [runs to the door and knocks it hard] SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: [Squidward continues knocking the door] Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend.
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone. [walks away]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bites into the donut again] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite! [Cuts to Shady Shoals Retirement Home, where SpongeBob and Patrick approach the manager]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Shady Shoals Caretaker: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. [The manager directs SpongeBob and Patrick, who are giggling in excitement, into the next room and points out Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who are watching TV] There they are. Right over there. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
Shady Shoals Caretaker: [whispers] Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: [holding onto SpongeBob] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV that Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are watching]
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
SpongeBob: But you can't retire! There's evil afoot!
Mermaid Man: Wha? Evil! Evil! [runs to a coral pot and starts hanging on it] Barnacle Boy! Come quick, I got the evil!
SpongeBob: All I said was, there's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: Evil! Evil! E...
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
Mermaid Man: [hanging on a water fountain. Incidental 88, who is nearby, shakes his head in disapproval] Evil! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil! [water squirts at him] Death raaaaay! [the caretaker comes, grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and throws them out]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and triumphant music plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. [fireworks appear]
Patrick: Ooh! Pretty lights!
[At the Shady Shoals Rest Home cafeteria]
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! [receives a slice of meatloaf into his bowl] To the broccoli! [receives some broccoli into his bowl. Mermaid Man looks at the orange cafeteria worker.] Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Orange cafeteria worker: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, away!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run! [They take their seats. Just then, SpongeBob arrives.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man. [approaches Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's table]
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy"?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass. [Incidental 88 moves his oatmeal away from SpongeBob in disgust]
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Shady Shoals Caretaker: [enters the cafeteria] What is going on in here?
Mermaid Man: [points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling] You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home, where Patrick was waiting for him]
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
Mermaid Man: [he and Barnacle Boy are in rocking chairs] Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
SpongeBob: [dressed up as a woman and speaking in a Southern accent] Oh, mah. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: [dressed up as a robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that. [grabs SpongeBob's purse]
SpongeBob: [screams] Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
Patrick: It's working.
SpongeBob: [Barnacle Boy comes over to him] Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: [yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup] Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
SpongeBob: [approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open] Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!
Mermaid Man: [wakes up] Stop shoutin'! I'm nappin'!
Barnacle Boy: [close up to his face] It's not me, you old coot!
Incidental 80: Yes?
Incidental 84: That's me.
Incidental 81: I'm over here. [cuts back to Mermaid Man, as he and Barnacle Boy start arguing with each other]
SpongeBob: [tugs on Mermaid Man pants] Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
Barnacle Boy: [enraged] Gah! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! [to Mermaid Man] We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: Evil! Where is it?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means? [opens up a box with their rings]
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother.
[Barnacle Boy puts one of the rings on Mermaid Man and then they try to put both of the rings together, but they miss. Superhero sequence fails. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy wave their arms around up and down to synchronize their positioning of their arms. So then they attempt to unite both of the rings together a second time. Both rings are successfully put together but the superhero sequence fails again.]
Barnacle Boy: Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [unite sequence succeeds while their rings are united together] Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens]
Patrick: Hehehehehe.
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away! [they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpool. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them]
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite! [they summon the sea creatures, but they are retired, so they come slowly]
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures, attack!
SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [sea creatures, now carrying torches and pitchforks, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick] Mission accomplished, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah, we did it. [sea creatures throw them out]
Mermaid Man: [happily] I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot. [they shake hands]
Mermaid Man: Who are you? [Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed]
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.]
[Mermaid Man places a black checker on the board. A "Pow!" pow-bubble appears. Barnacle Boy replies by placing a red checker on the board. "Clack!" appears. Mermaid Man sweats, then places a black checker to the end of the board. A "King Me!" appears. Suddenly the phone rings.]
Mermaid Man: It's the Aquaphone! [he holds the phone upside down] What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello? [Hangs up phone. "HANG UP!" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ["SIT!" appears]
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: It's all thanks to you. [SpongeBob winks; "WINK!" appears].
Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Incidental 31: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Maybe... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Hmmm... I'll have... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Incidental 31: I'll have a Krabby Patty. [Squidward writes down order]
Squidward: How original.
Incidental 31: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes order and shows SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders]
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! [cracks knuckles; adds each ingredient as mentioned] First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [bell rings]
Squidward: Whatever. [Incidental 5 comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to Incidental 5] It's been a thrill serving you.
Incidental 5: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We're all out.
Incidental 5: Could you check?
Squidward: No. [Incidental 5 glares at Squidward as he leaves. Bubble Bass walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. [SpongeBob shows Squidward he has already gotten the order done]
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass!
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants! [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty]
Crowd: [gasp]
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [checks patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [customers are disappointed; tears the patty apart, finding the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, but also throws Squidward out of the way again]
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee']
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]
Bubble Bass: No.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes money back]
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! (sobs) Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! [tries again] Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? What? [SpongeBob walks out and goes home]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. [walks out] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula] No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. [at night]
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning and the rooster crows where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is on the floor under his bed] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off. At The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward coughs loudly, and clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher] Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]
Incidental 30: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Incidental 63: He burnt my fries!
Incidental 65: [Briefly drinks his burnt shake until realizing it is burnt.] He burnt my shake!
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! (sobs) No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
[cuts to SpongeBob's house, he nailed a toaster to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [now he has underwear on his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... I'm gonna help ya! [shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room] If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [realizes that he just put the patty together in the right order]
Mr. Krabs: It's time.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rescues Squidward from the burning kitchen and sprays him with the fire extinguisher]
Incidental 70: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [men and women are cheering]
Bubble Bass: (He enters the building, shoving the large crowd of people out of his way in the process) I hear SquarePants is back! [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong. [holds up bubbles and blows one] .
Bubble Bass: [Gives a weird sounding roar]
SpongeBob: Rawr.
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation]
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular, and this time, don't forget the pickles.
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I didn't.
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty]
Bubble Bass: Hmm... ...Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it and they’re disgusted] You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [looks at Bubble Bass's mouth] Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!
Incidental 45: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [rushes out of the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Scene changes to outside of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
Customer: Boo! You stink!
Narrator: Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This week's hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps and shakes nervously] ...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Incidental 27: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Phil?
Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
Incidental 8: Hey, I've done it 3 times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer]
Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth!
Student: She graduated!
Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air]
SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him the uniform]
SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point almost everyone, is asleep] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears." [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform; deep voice] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: [muffled] I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so.
SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off the uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives the uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [cut to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. Then notices a broken traffic light]
SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the [deep voice] hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred: My leg! My leg!
SpongeBob: On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating]
Incidental 12: More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window and begins walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick sitting on top of a wall and eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm down here.
Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! [hops off SpongeBob and pulls him off the ground] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you! [fixes his shape]
Patrick: Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries]
Morty: [High Voice] Extra! Extra! "Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [High voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, [deep voice] the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream]
SpongeBob: This isn't working. [throws his ice cream away] We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick drops his ice cream and happily grabs a walkie-talkie] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick]
Incidental 118: Afternoon, son.
Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat]
Incidental 118: Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Orange Incidental 118: Have you seen this man?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.]
Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!
Incidental 118: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand?
Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.
Incidental 118: Okay. [Orange Incidental 118 shows Patrick the poster again]
Patrick: [screams] Horrible!
[Orange Incidental 118 removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Orange Incidental 118 repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.]
Incidental 118: Stay indoors, son.
Orange Incidental 118: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off]
Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: [sighs] Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark.
SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it; Patrick gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign that says Conch Street and Coral Avenue]
SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly! [screams over walkie-talkie] Get out of there, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams] That's his maniac shriek! He's going to attack! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! Run! Hide behind that building! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light! [SpongeBob gets under the street lights] No wait, agh, he's there, too! Run for your life! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out]
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy?
Patrick: The maniac's in the mailbox! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through three buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plasted with wanted posters]
SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background and a mass of police cars and several policeman surround SpongeBob]
Incidental 118: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words]
Incidental 118: You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. 6 months from now! [jail closure sound]
Narrator: Ah, Jellyfish Fields. Here we find SpongeBob once again stalking the wild jellyfish. SpongeBob? Allô? SpongeBob? Hmmm... he's supposed to be here somewhere... [narrator looks around and sees a square-shaped coral] A-ha! [Jellyfish floats by. SpongeBob puts his glasses on]
SpongeBob: Safety first. [SpongeBob slides to a jellyfish and captures it] A-ha! I finally gotcha! [SpongeBob grabs a wooden stool and sits on it. Puts on a farmer hat and 'milks' the jellyfish. Jelly comes out and squirts on a piece of bread. The jellyfish moos like a cow. He eats and starts speaking like the Narrator.] Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later! [walks off but jellyfish floats towards him with his glasses] Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye! [the jellyfish floats with SpongeBob] I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home. [jellyfish hangs onto SpongeBob's nose] No. You can't go home with me. [jellyfish walks behind him. The jellyfish's steps are squeaking, like SpongeBob's] Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! [the jellyfish floats towards SpongeBob] Hey! [puts the jellyfish on a rock] Stay! [walks backwards] Stay... [jellyfish floats around SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs the jellyfish and uses a slingshot to launch him somewhere else but the jellyfish ends up on his back. The jellyfish giggles. SpongeBob pulls the jellyfish off] [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me! [SpongeBob looks at the jellyfish sternly. The jellyfish deflates as if he was sad. SpongeBob decides to keep him] Ahh, what the heck! [SpongeBob, with the jellyfish on a rope, like a dog, walk by Squidward's house] Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard! [Squidward peeks out his window] Squidward! Look at my new pet!
Squidward: That's no pet, that's a wild animal.
SpongeBob: No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch! [throws a stick so the jellyfish returns it. SpongeBob is holding up three fingers] How many fingers am I holding up? [the jellyfish hums deeply three times] Play dead! [jellyfish is buried underground with a tomb that says "R.I.P.". He pops up]
Squidward: I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained! [the jellyfish, still on the rope, is on a toilet reading a newspaper as he hums casually] I didn't need to see that.
SpongeBob: Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
Squidward: How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish? [SpongeBob and the jellyfish dance to some music. Also, various colors change as they dance. Disco lights rotate around the room. SpongeBob's house is vibrating from the music] SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... for 12 hours!
SpongeBob: [stops dancing. He is exhausted, sees the jellyfish dance more] Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. [turns the music off] It's time to go to bed. [as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on] Huh? [walks over to turn the music off] You got it all wrong, little fella. [the jellyfish turns the music back on. SpongeBob turns it back off] Bed. Repeat after me. [SpongeBob ties the rope around the jellyfish] Bed! [the jellyfish reaches for the stereo but SpongeBob pulls it off. Upstairs, SpongeBob ties the rope around his bedpost] We'll just keep you right here.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody. [as he is sleeping throughout the night, other jellyfish float inside the pineapple]
Gary: [wakes up] Meow. [jellyfish opens the window, and the 4 jellyfish talking in jellyfish speaking. Gary gets angry] Meow. [gets squirted with jelly from all the jellyfish, they laugh at Gary, and continue squirting jelly on him] Meow. [More jellyfish enter SpongeBob's House. It's now daytime and the rooster crows everyone up]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! [puts on his green robe and goes to check downstairs]
Gary: [Follows SpongeBob to the doorway, while completely filled with jelly.] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, jellyfi-! [slips on some jelly. Opens a door leading into his living room and sees jellyfish dancing to music. The jellyfish are having a dance party.] Where'd you all come from? [jellyfish form a figure of a hand and the hand grabs SpongeBob. They stick over a light bulb like a disco ball and spin him. Then falls to the ground] Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome. [As SpongeBob is walking to the stereo, jellyfish form a flight of stairs that SpongeBob walks up and but does not notice] This music is way too loud. [He screams as he falls down. Jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a triangle] Very funny. [jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a rectangle] I'm serious! [Jellyfish carry SpongeBob up and down the screen. The scene then goes to SpongeBob's house bouncing up and down because of the loud party. Squidward's house. Squidward is still lying in his bed, holding a pillow against his face. He has not slept all night.]
Squidward: Grr! 18 hours! [falls off his bed, picks up the phone and dials SpongeBob's number] I'm gonna give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!
Jellyfish: [Cut back to the party. The phone rings and a jellyfish picks it up.] [garbled] Hello?
Squidward: SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears! I've had enough of this! [Jelly squirts through the phone and onto Squidward's face] Strawberry. [Squidward plays his clarinet outside his window] Two can play at this! [plays "Row Row Row Your Boat" with his clarinet badly. Jellyfish form a smiley face.]
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, enough is enough! [SpongeBob hears the clarinet music in the distance.] Huh? [Cuts back to the Jellyfish's smile, but this time, turns into an angry frown when Squidward plays his clarinet] Uh-oh! [Jellyfish sting SpongeBob] Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him! [SpongeBob peeks his head out his window] Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
Squidward: The jellyfish don't like...? [sarcastically] Why, sure, pal, I can play better.
SpongeBob: Okay, he said he'll play better. [Squidward's house rotates slowly towards SpongeBob's house. He has a giant amp set behind him. In front of him is a microphone. Squidward inhales deeply as his house stretches, then he plays "Row Row Row Your Boat" with his clarinet again, but extremely loudly.] Uh-oh! That's not better! [Jellyfish knocks SpongeBob's coral plant over] Hey! Take it easy with that! [The jellyfish knock over his television] Those are my things! [The jellyfish knock over a wall decoration] Don't break th- Dow! [The jellyfish float out of the party and into Squidward's house]
Squidward: Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down. Ow! Ow! Ow! [the jellyfish sting Squidward and float back into SpongeBob's house, returning to their party. A welt-covered Squidward walks up to the door and gives SpongeBob his clarinet] Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore.
SpongeBob: Hey, now, that wasn't nice! [jellyfish take the clarinet and snap it in half. A fire forms and they dance around it in a circle. Boat horn toots as SpongeBob finally reaches his breaking point, shouting] Okay, that is it! Everybody out! [He grabs the stereo and runs toward the door but the jellyfish try to take it back so they can party more. Both sides accidentally let go and the stereo falls to floor and shatters into pieces with a crash causing the music to stop. SpongeBob gulps and the jellyfish start to quiver, due to the loss of the music, thus ending their party. SpongeBob stammers. The jellyfish get angry and sting SpongeBob] Come on, Gary! [SpongeBob and Gary head up to the roof. SpongeBob's house vibrates forcefully, and the jellyfish start to swarm around the house.] Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in. [SpongeBob looks scared and his teeth chatter. Gary clicks his eyes together making a beat that the jellyfish can dance to.] Huh? They stopped? [holds Gary's eyes together and the jellyfish get angry again. Then he lets go of Gary's eyes and they dance again. Does this a couple more times and notices a trend.] Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it! [takes Gary to Jellyfish Fields. Along the way, SpongeBob has other creatures and things join in the rhythm. Eventually, he gets the jellyfish back home to Jellyfish Fields and he runs back to his home.]
Narrator: Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea's harshest lessons: wild animals can throw very wild parties. [SpongeBob shakes Gary's eye, congratulating him. Squidward sinks down into his bubble bath as he groans in pain] Ooh, I felt that.
